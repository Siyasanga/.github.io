          <h4>Dubai</h4>
          <p>Dubai is a city and emirate in the United Arab Emirates
            known for luxury shopping, ultramodern architecture and a
            lively nightlife scene. Burj Khalifa, an 830m-tall tower,
            dominates the skyscraper-filled skyline.
            At its foot lies Dubai Fountain, with jets and lights choreographed
            to music. On artificial islands just offshore is Atlantis, The Palm,
            a resort with water and marine-animal parks.</p>

              other side cutting, through which gangs of sweating convicts pushed cocopans full of stone to where
              Quay 5, past where Ferrymans, Mitchell's Brewery the Amphitheatre are today. Much later the cutting was
              roofed over and built on, and during World War II was actually converted - fortunately
              without ever being needed - for use as an air-raid shelter.</td>
