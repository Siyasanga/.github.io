Right next to the Ulundi parking Garage is the Historic Tunnel.
The old builders of 1860 had a great problem - they had to get stone quarried from
what is now the V&A Waterfront Marina to the other side cutting, through which gangs of
sweating convicts pushed cocopans full of stone to where Quay 5, past where Ferrymans, Mitchell's Brewery
the Amphitheatre are today. Much later the cutting was roofed over and built on, and during World War II was actually converted - fortunately
without ever being needed - for use as an air-raid shelter.

African Trading Port (ATP) has attempted to bring Africa under one roof.
Artwork from practically each and every African country and culture is available.
ATP’s roots started with the establishment of an art workshop in Zimbabwe in 1978.
ATP's current location is the Old Port Captain’s Building at Cape Town’s Waterfront since 2001.
